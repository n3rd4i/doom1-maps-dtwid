Title                   : Doom the Way id Did
Filename                : DTWID.WAD
Release date            : 12/10/11
Version                 : 1.1a (revised 2/5/12)
Author                  : Various
Email Address           : doom.the.way.id.did@gmail.com

Description             : "At some point in time I got the idea that it
                          would be really fun if John Romero dusted off the
                          ol' doom editor and made another map for Doom
                          episode 1 for old time's sake.
                          He once replied to an email saying 'maybe I
                          will!' but never did get around to it as far as
                          I know.

                          This project asks the contributors to carefully
                          study the original maps and try to make them as
                          John Romero and Sandy Petersen did.

                          The guiding principle in the project is to
                          pretend that id Software initially intended to
                          release Doom as a three episode, 30 level game,
                          but somehow lost three levels; one from each
                          episode.

                          The mappers for the project are trying to create
                          those lost tenth levels, except we are extending
                          this concept to be a full 3 episode replacement.

                          Our goal is to make the 'lost' maps as
                          authentically as possible to be convincingly
                          mistaken for original levels from the game, to
                          recreate Doom the Way id Did."

Rules of Determination:
- Rounded down to nearest 15sec then +30sec
- Pistol start
- HMP difficulty
- 4 runs per map (mean average is used)

NOTE from St. Alfonzo: "I took the fastest available route for
each map, killing only those monsters that got in my way or
proved too great a threat to ignore. If I became low on health,
ammo or armor I would seek out items only if they were immediately
accessible. I ignored all secrets - including those most
convenient - and did not exploit design flaws that would aid in
improving my time.
